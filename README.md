Welcome to the game! To start, enter one of the following commands:

brain-even
brain-calc
brain-gcd
brain-progression
brain-prime

The goal of each game is to give three correct answers in a row. If you make at least one mistake, you will lose.

It is important to follow the conditions of the game. For example, if you need to answer "yes", only the answer "yes" will be accepted. If you answer differently, you will be defeated.

Game descriptions:

brain-even
In this game, you need to determine whether a number is even or not.

brain-calc
Here, you will be given two random numbers and must perform a mathematical operation on them.

brain-gcd
In this game, you need to find the greatest common divisor for two numbers. Only a number should be entered as an answer.

brain-progression
In this game, you must find the missing link in an arithmetic progression.

brain-prime
Here, you need to determine whether a number is prime or not. If yes, the answer is "yes"; otherwise, the answer is "no".

Good luck in the game!
